## Problem 1.1

Which of the following statements are true? For those that are false, give a counter-example. 

(i) If $\{a_1,a_2,a_3\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$
and $b$ is a non-zero vector in $\mathbb{R}$ 
then $\{b+a_1,a_2,a_3\}$ is also a basis a for $\mathbb{R}^3$.

(ii) If $\mathbf{A}$ is a finite set of linearly independent vectors then the dimension of the subspace spanned by $\mathbf{A}$ is equal to the number of vectors in $\mathbf{A}$. 

(iii) The subspace $\{(x,x,x)\ |\ x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ has dimension 3. 

(iv) If $\\mathbf{A}$ is a linearly dependent set of vectors in \mathbb{R}^n then there are more than *n* vectors in ***A***. 

(v) If ***A*** is a linearly dependent subset of \mathbb{R}^n  then the dimension of the subspace spanned by ***A*** is strictly less than the number of vectors in ***A***. 

(vi) If ***A*** is a subset of \mathbb{R}^n and the subspace spanned by ***A*** is \mathbb{R}^n itself then ***A*** contains exactly *n* vectors. 

(vii) If *A* and *B* are subspaces of \mathbb{R}^n then we can find a basis of \mathbb{R}^n which contains a basis of *A* and a basis of *B*. 

(viii) An *n*-dimensional vector space contains only finitely many sub-spaces. 

(ix) If ***A*** is an *n* \times *n* matrix over \mathbb{Q} with *A*^3 = *I* then *A* is non-singular. 

(x) If ***A*** is an *n* \times *n* matrix over \mathbb{C} with *A*^3 = *I* then *A* is non-singular. 

(xi) An isomorphism between two vector spaces can always be represented by a square singular matrix. 

(xii) Any two *n*-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic. 

(xiii) If ***A*** is an *n* \times *n* matrix such that *A*^2 = *I* then *A* = *I*.  

(xiv) If A , B and C are non-zero matrices such that AC = BC then A = B. 

(xv) The identity map on \mathbb{R} is represented by the identity matrix with respect to any basis of \mathbb{R}^n 

(xvi) Given any two bases of \mathbb{R}^n there is an isomorphism from \mathbb{R}^n to itself that that maps one basis onto the other.

## corollary 3.5

Let V be a vector space and let $W$ be a subspace.  If $dim W = dim V$ then $V = W$

## Corollary 3.6

Let V be a vector space of dimension n. 
Let r be a positive integer with r < n, 
and let $v_1 , \dots , v_r$ be linearly independent elements of V. 
Then one can find elements $v_r+1 , \dots , v_n$ such that 
$$ { v_1 , \dots , v_n } $$ 
is a basis of V. 

## Theorem 3.7

Let V be a vector space having a basis consisting of n elements. Let W be a subspace which does not consist of O alone. 
Then W has a basis , and the dimension of W is $\leq n$. 

## Theorem 4.1 

Let V be a Vector space over the field K, and let U, W be subspaces. If U + W = V, and if $U \cap W = O$ , then V is the direct sum of U and W.
